[Simplr ](https://simplr-eta.vercel.app/)

Simplr is a **single-page application** built with **React** that makes understanding complex ideas effortless.

## What it does
Simplr takes anything confusing — a webpage, a document, or even abstract ideas like love or quantum physics — and explains it in plain, simple language.

- **Input:** Paste a link or some text.  
- **Output:** Simplr translates it into a form you can actually understand.  
- **Customization:** Choose how you want it explained:
  - Short and simple  
  - Detailed but clear  
  - “Like I’m five”  

Learning doesn’t have to feel like work — it just needs to be **Simplr**.

## How it works
Simplr uses **AI as a middle logic layer** to process input and generate explanations that are easy to digest.

## Technologies Used
- React  
- AI integration for content simplification
